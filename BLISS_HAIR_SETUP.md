## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background is best
- **Style**: Simple, clear, recognizable

### Service Descriptions
Keep them short and appealing:
- ✅ "Professional cut with wash, styling and blow dry"
- ❌ "We will cut your hair and then wash it and style it..."

### Pricing Strategy
- Round numbers look clean (£45, £50, £75)
- Or end in .95 for perceived value (£44.95, £74.95)
- Group similar services for easy comparison
