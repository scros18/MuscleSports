# Layout Builder - Authentication Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved!

### Issue
The Layout Builder was getting a **401 Unauthorized** error when trying to save layouts.

### Root Cause
The authentication token was being read from the wrong localStorage key:
- **Wrong**: `localStorage.getItem('token')`
- **Correct**: `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')`

### What Was Fixed

Changed all three functions in `/app/admin/layout-builder/page.tsx`:

1. **loadLayout()** - Now uses `auth_token`
2. **saveLayout()** - Now uses `auth_token` + better error handling
3. **resetLayout()** - Now uses `auth_token` + better error handling

### Enhanced Error Messages

Now shows helpful alerts:
- ⚠️ **"Authentication token not found"** - If not logged in
- ⚠️ **"Unauthorized. Please log in as admin"** - If token is invalid
- ❌ **"Failed to save layout: [reason]"** - If save fails
- ✅ **"Layout saved! Changes are now live"** - On success

### How to Use Now

1. **Make sure you're logged in as admin**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Log in with admin credentials
   - This sets the `auth_token` in localStorage

2. **Navigate to Layout Builder**
   - Go to `/admin/layout-builder`
   - Layout should load automatically

3. **Make changes and save**
   - Drag sections to reorder
   - Toggle visibility with eye icons
   - Click "Save Layout"
   - See success message!

### Testing Authentication

To check if you're authenticated:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type: `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')`
4. Should return a JWT token string

If it returns `null`, you need to log in again.

### Troubleshooting

**Still getting 401?**
1. Log out and log back in
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check that your user account has `role = 'admin'`
4. Verify JWT_SECRET environment variable is set

**Token expired?**
- Tokens expire after a certain time
- Just log in again to get a fresh token

**Other errors?**
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Check server logs for API errors
- Verify database connection is working

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and ready to use!
