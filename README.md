## Design Philosophy

### Border Radius System
- `sm` (0.5rem): Badges, small buttons
- `md` (0.625rem): Form inputs
- **`lg` (0.75rem): Default** - Cards, buttons, modals
- `xl` (1rem): Large feature cards
- `2xl` (1.25rem): Special hero elements

**Rationale**: Creates a professional, modern look without excessive roundness. Softened but still business-appropriate.

### Color System
- Semantic naming (primary, secondary, muted, accent)
- HSL-based for perfect dark mode transitions
- Consistent opacity levels (10%, 20%, 50%, 80%)
- WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios

### Typography
- Clear hierarchy with 6 text sizes
- Proper font weights (400, 500, 600, 700)
- Line height optimized for readability
- Responsive sizing on mobile
