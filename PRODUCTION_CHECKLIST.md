## Pre-Deployment Steps

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Your Site Name
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Build & Test
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run build
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm start

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Database
- [ ] Run migrations
- [ ] Seed initial data if needed
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Set up backups

### Security
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Enable CSP headers
- [ ] Review .env.example and ensure no secrets committed

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure analytics
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### SEO
- [ ] Submit sitemap to search engines
- [ ] Configure robots.txt
- [ ] Set up Google Search Console
- [ ] Add structured data
